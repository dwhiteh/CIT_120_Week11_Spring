                        <h2>Hefeweizen</h2>
                        <p>Brewed in the Fountain Square neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana at the Fountain Square
                            Brewery, the Kosmik Hefeweizen has been discontinued for winter months is making its return.
                            Known for its strong banana flavor, this wheat beer is very refreshing with a 5.9% ABV and
                            6 IBU.

                        <h2>American Pale Wheat</h2>
                        <p>Brewed in Terre Haute, Indiana at the Terre Haute Brewing Company, the CitraGenesis
                            is an American Pale Wheat beer. It has 5% ABV and 15 IBU. THBC is claiming massive amounts of Citra
                            flavors with this one. This would be a great beer for the Spring as we transition from the
                            heavier winter beers to the lighter, crisper Summer beers.

                            kettle soured ale. It has a 6% ABV and a 5 IBU. Grapefruit, peach and strawberry flavors are combined
                            with aromas from rose and hibiscus petals to give this sour a pinkish-purple hue. Get it while you can.

                        <h2>Dark Mexican Lager</h2>
                        <p>Brewed in Indianapolis, Indiana at the Chilly Water Brewing Company, the Mama Tried is a dark Mexican
                            lager. It has a 5.6% ABV and an unknown IBU. This one is slightly malty and pairs excellent with a lime.

                        <h2>Cream Ale</h2>
                        <p>Brewed in Indianapolis, Indiana at the Sun King Brewery, the Sunlight Cream Ale is another example of
                            a malty beer that is also crisp and refreshing. It has a 5.3% ABV and 20 IBU. This is brewed year-round
                            but in my opinion is best suited for the Spring time.
